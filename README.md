Inroduction

Hi my name is Chris Jackson, I am a senior Informatics student with a cognate in Graphic Design. I began my freshman year of college as an Intelligent Systems
Engineering major, but I soon found my spot in Informatics later in that year. I have had many average jobs such as working at a grocery store, yet I haven't 
attained an internship yet. I am a pretty big sports guy following basketball and football, along with baseball occasionally, and I enjoy to play these 
sports as well. I enjoy playing basketball, drawing, listening to and making music, as well as hanging out with a group of my peers. After college I 
plan on going into the reak world for a while and have graduate school on my mind but not in immediate view. I look forward to engaging and learning new material 
within this class and hope to learn how to apply it in a real world working environment.
